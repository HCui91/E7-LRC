# E7-LRC 
This repository contained codes for the 2nd year experiment *Study of an Oscillating Electrical System Driven into Resonance*. It would import data from csv file and output plotting with phase difference and angle.
## From experiment to this code

### From your RLC circuit

You will need to change the variables from line 13

```python
##### Theoritical value #####

L=18e-3         #Inductance of the inductor in Henry (H)

C=1800e-12      #Capacitance of the capacitor in Faraday (F)

R=820           #Resistance of the resistor in Ohm

```

Note: 18e-3 means 18*10^{-3}

### From your experiment data
